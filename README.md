# PennGrader
Welcome to the PennGrader!

Here at PennGrader we believe that learning comes from lots of practice...and from making lots of mistakes. After many years as a student I found myself so frustrated in the following homework flow: struggle on a homework for weeks, submit something that may or may not be right and then wait weeks for any type of feedback, by which I had forgotten all about the homeowork. After many years as a TA I also found myself very frustrated with the current autograding tools, especially for Jupyter Notebooks. From this frustrations the PennGrader was born!
